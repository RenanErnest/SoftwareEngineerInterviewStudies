# SoftwareEngineerInterviewStudies
Software Engineer Interview preparation for code and design junior/entry-level interviews as well as correlated studies.
As per the date of this commit, if you are focusing your studies to pass an generic software engineer interview, I would recommend to start with Data Structures, followed by Sorting and Search algorithms, Behavioral Questions and then Object Oriented Design if it is a requirement for your desired role. Be resilience in your preparation and good luck!
